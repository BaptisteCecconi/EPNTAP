The EPN-TAP parameter lists are maintained on Obspm's confluence wiki,
at least while this document is still in WD.

See:
https://voparis-confluence.obspm.fr/display/VES/EPN-TAP+v2+parameter+description

Parameter metadata can be taken from:
https://voparis-confluence.obspm.fr/display/VES/EPN-TAP+V2.0+parameters
(but there are outdated parameters there, too).


The bulk of this document is generated from there.  DO NOT EDIT anything
between the GENERATED and /GENERATED comments here, edit it on the
confluence wiki.

To pull the changes from there into the current document, say

make generate

Please commit before and after a run of make generate to keep the
remaining diffs usable.
