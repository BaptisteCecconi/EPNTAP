# Publishing Solar System Data to the Virtual Observatory

This document defines the EPN-TAP framework, which is using 
TAP with the EPNcore metadata dictionary. The EPNcore metadata 
dictionary defines the core components that are necessary to 
perform data discovery in the Solar System related science 
fields. 
It includes keywords to describe data products coverage 
(temporal, spectral, spatial, photometric), origin (instrument, facility), 
content (target, physical parameters), access, references, etc. 
Its implementation with TAP (Table Access Protocol) is presented, 
including service registration guidelines. 
Topical extension metadata dictionaries are also presented.
